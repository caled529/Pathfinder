To indicate a path, use a period (".").
To indicate an obstacle, use a hash mark ("#").
To indicate the starting point for the character, use an uppercase c ("C").
To indicate the goal, use an uppercase g ("G").

See "default.txt" under maps/ for an example (this is the default map loaded on
startup).

Special behaviour:
- At least one path must be placed in order for a file to be loaded
- In the event that multiple character starting points are placed, the one
  furthest to the left, closest to the bottom, in that order, will be the actual
  starting point for the character.
- When no character starting point can be found, the character will start at the
  path closest to the right side of the screen, nearest to the top, in that
  order.
